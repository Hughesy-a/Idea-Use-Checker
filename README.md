# Idea-Use-Checker
The goal of this project was that I had some business Ideas that I didn't know if they were done before, I wanted to know if it had been done so I could tell if I could be first to market. With that in mind, I made this crew to help comb the internet and find out if the idea had been done. This uses an AI crew running a ChatGPT-3.5 turbo API with custom prompting and a wide range of tools including internet access, content searching and more with a ReAct model structure using CrewAI.
